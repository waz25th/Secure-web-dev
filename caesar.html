  <h1>Gaius Julius Caesar</h1>
  <p> <img src="jc.jpg" alt="Caesar" style="width:150px; height:150px;"/> Born on 13/07/100BC, known as Julius Caesar; was a Roman politician, general and notable author of Latin prose, playing a critical role in the rise of the Roman Empire.</p>
 <p> An alleged descendant of the goddess Venus, he became the head of his family at the age of 16.</p>
 
 <h1> The Gallic Wars</h1>
 <p> These were a series of campaigns waged by Julius Caesar in his two terms as proconsul of Cisalpine Gaul, Transalpine Gaul and Illyricum, against several Gallic tribes.</p>
 
<p> Gaul in 59 BC Caesar's greatest military victory was the conquest of Gaul (France) in which 55,000 Romans battled 250,000 Celts in a campaign that lasted from 58 to 51 B.C. 58 B.C., after serving a year as consul, Caesar had himself named the governor of Gaul, where he distinguished himself as a superb organizer and a motivator of soldiers with whom he worked with, fought with and suffered with. He inspired such respect and affection from the men who served under him it was said they would do anything for him. </p>
<p> <img src="57.jpg" alt"57BC" style="width: 150px; height:150px;"/>  During his years in Gaul Caesar inexorably expanded Roman territory by defeating one tribe after another. He crossed the Rhine in 55 B.C. to preempt a German invasion. In 52 B.C., he put down the last great Gallic-Celtic uprising. Vercingetorix, the leader of the Gallic-Celtic forces, surrendered himself at the feet of Caesar who sent him to Rome where the Gallic leader was imprisoned for six years and then paraded through the streets and strangled in the Forum</p>

<h1> Transitioning to an Empire</h1>
<p> Caesar's campaign in Gaul allowed Rome to claim France, the Netherlands and Belgium. In campaigns early in the Civil Wars period he claimed Portugal, Spain, and Greece. With Egypt under the control of Cleopatra, Caesar set his sights on the Middle East.</p>

	<h1>
		15th of March, 44BC
	</h1>
	<p> This date marks the assassination of Gaius, who was due to appear at the Senate. Many had plotted on the death of Caesar. Marshalled by Cassius Longinus, Decimus Junius Brutus and Marcus Junius Brutus, Caesar was stabbed to death adjacent to the Theatre of Pompey.</p>
<h1> Dictatorship </h1>
<p>Holding both a dictatorship and tribunate and alternating between consulship and the preconsulship, he was appointed Dictator in 49 BC, resigned and then was appointed Dictator again in 48 BC for an indefinite period, he was then appointed Dictator for a third time in 46BC for 10 years. One month before his assassination he was appointed Dictator for Life. </p>
